Tuples allow you to define an array with elements of different types.
  ex
    let x: [string, number];
      x = ["hello", 10]; //valid
      x = [10, "hello"]; //invalid
  elements outside of set known indices use a union type
    this is basically a check for any already defined type in the tuple.
